Kiss Cam v10 — Full Landscape (R2,T2)
-------------------------------------
- Designed for holding the iPhone sideways with camera on the LEFT and the top of the phone facing the FLOOR (R2,T2).
- Canvas rendering is rotated -90 degrees by default so the live feed appears upright on the Mac/LED.
- Buttons are bottom-left (Searching) and bottom-right (Kiss!).
- High-res canvas + stable centered pinch-to-zoom. Double-tap resets zoom.
- If orientation looks wrong, use the small (hidden) rotate selector at the top-right to switch rotation.

Installation:
1. Upload index.html, style.css, script.js, README.txt to the root of your repo (nijel).
2. Commit and wait ~10-30s.
3. Open https://kimberlytanhh.github.io/nijel?v=10 on your iPhone (hold landscape with camera on left, top towards floor).
4. Start Kiss Cam, pinch to zoom (centered), press Kiss! to burst hearts.

Notes:
- If the mirrored image on the Mac looks flipped or rotated, change the Rotate selector to 90 or 0.
- For best results, add the page to Home Screen and then mirror (AirPlay) the phone to the Mac, or mirror the phone directly to the Mac via AirPlay.
